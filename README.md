#### About Me

Hello my name is Luis Carlos Alvarez Yauca, I am passionate about coding, and can spend hours researching for ways to be more efficient (I feel like I cannot get tired while coding).

I love keyboard shortcuts, it would be the first thing I would look into when interacting with a software for the first time.

I am also a Git enthusiast, it makes me feel safe while experimenting with my code.

#### Current Stack

Currently I am into both front-end and back-end and I have knowledge in:
- Java (Spring Boot)
- Vue3
- React
- Node (Express, Nest, Next)
- C

#### Contact
